    <h3>Beginning</h3>
  <p>
      I always used to aspire to fellow coders at how good they are in cp,but In beginning I was unable to sove a single questions.
      Then slowly I started in <strong><em>hackerrank</em></strong>,I was very slow.However slow I was,I stuck to it and then corona thing happened.
      <em>I came to home from hostel</em> and seriously speed
      up the pace and boom I shift to <strong>codeforces</strong> and then something happened
        </p>
        <h3>Middle phase</h3>
        <p>
          After shifting to <strong> codeforces</strong> ,I was getting improved day by day till I reached <em>specialist</em> on codeforces,Once I reaches there
          I got slow and getting slow and slow... Eventually I started failing but again I took <strong><em>pledge</em></strong> to reach expert
